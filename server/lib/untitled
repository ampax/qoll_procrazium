By ?= the surface area of the reactants, the rate of reaction is increased.

Rate of reaction generally ?= with the rise of temperature.

A ?= is a substance, which either accelerates or retards the rate of reaction without taking part in the reaction.

In the preparation of Oxygen from Potassium Chlorate, ?= is used as catalyst.

In the oxidation of SO2 to SO3 by the contact process for the manufacture of H2SO4 ?= is used as catalyst.

An unstable intermediate compound formed during a chemical reaction is called ?=.

When a catalyst and the reactants are in the same phases, it is known as ?= catalyst.

When a catalyst and the reactants are in different phases, it is called ?= .

When a catalyst increases the rate of reaction, it is called ?= catalyst.

When a catalyst retards the rate of reaction, it is called ?= catalyst.

A negative catalyst ?= the energy of activation, hence the rate of reaction is decreased.

The ratio between the rate of reaction and concentration of reactants is known as ?= .

28. Velocity constant is independent of concentration but depends on __________.

29. Ionic reactions are __________ than molecular reactions.

30. The value of specific rates constant for a reaction __________ with time.

31. The sum of all exponents of concentration terms in the equation is called __________.
#

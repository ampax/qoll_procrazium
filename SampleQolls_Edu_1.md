 2The following questions refer to Figures 15 and 16.
 2all atoms are made from the same three pieces in Figure 15. Every
 2tiny atom is like a solar system.  Its central "sun" has one or
 2more protons, generally neutrons, too.  The revolving "planets"
 2are the electrons, one for each proton in the nucleus, because
 2plus and minus must balance in the atom.
 2The opposite charges attract but high speed keeps the electrons
 2in their circular paths. All the weight of the atom may be
 2considered to be in the nucleus since the electron weighs only
 21/1850 of the proton.
 2The atom is mostly empty space. If the nucleus were enlarged
 2to the size of a baseball, the electron would be a mere speck
 22000 feet away. Electrons supply the energy for chemical reactions
 2like burning coal or the explosion of tnt. The nucleus
 2evades all ordinary chemical reactons. Its energy can be
 2released only by direct hits on the nucleus to break the bonds
 2that hold the protons and neutrons in a tight bundle.
 2Uranium is nature's heaviest atom called U-238. It is not
 2directly usable for energy release, but an element may have
 2several isotopes--alternate forms with the same number of
 2protons but slightly different numbers of neutrons. The material
 2needed for direct atomic energy release is U-235 which consists
 2of only .7 per cent of natural uranium. The separation of the
 2uranium isotopes is difficult since they are chemically the same
 2element.
 2Relatively slow neutron bullets can split U-235 into lighter
 2atoms and give several neutrons to split other U-235 atoms
 2setting up a chain of explosions that may sweep through a block
 2of U-235 releasing energy equivalent to 11,400,000 kilowatt-hours
 2per pound.
 2We now have a man-made new element, number 94 with 145
 2neutrons, called plutonium which can also be split like u-235.
 2in an elementary way the principle of atomic explosion can
 2be shown by Figure 16.
 2To answer the following questions, select from the key the
 2most appropriate response.
 2  A. The first part of the statement is true, and its truth
 2        is supported by the reason given in the statement.

3 Plutonium is listed as element 94 because it has 94 electrons.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 4 
  U-238 has the same atomic weight as U-234 because
4 U-234 is an isotope of U-238.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 5

5 because atoms are neutral in charge.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 6 
  Plutonium is heavier than U-238 as evidenced by its
6 greater atomic weight.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 7 
  The chance of a direct hit on the nucleus by an electron
7 bullet is good because the atom is mostly empty space.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 8 
  Centripetal force keeps electrons in their orbits because

 2The following paragraphs concern the action of
 2a geyser. Read the passage carefully and answer the items by
 2using the key.
 2A geyser is a hot spring that erupts at intervals. It is made up
 2of a more or less crooked, or constricted, tubular fissure that
 2extends into the earth and is filled with water. A source of heat
 2near the bottom of the fissure heats the water.
 2After an eruption the tube fills with water from an underground
 2source. The water throughout most of the length of the tube,
 2and especially in the lower part, becomes heated to a point
 2above the normal boiling temperature (212 degrees F.) of water but
 2does not become quite hot enough to turn to steam. However,
 2sooner or later, some of the water in the lower part of the tube at
 2the source of heat reaches the boiling point and turns to steam.
 2The steam raises the whole column of water above it and causes
 2some water to overflow from the geyser pool at the surface.
 2This overflow acts as a trigger, permitting the whole column
 2of water in the tube to flash into steam which blows from the
 2fissure in an eruption.
 2  A. Statement is true and pertains directly to the action
 2        of the geyser.
 2  B. Statement is true but is not directly concerned with
 2        the action of the geyser.
 2  C. Statement is false.

1 Water has one of the lowest specific heats of any common substance.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 2 
  The boiling point of water in the bottom of the tube is
2 lower than that at the top.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 3 
  The water in the tube does not turn to steam although
  it is above the normal boiling point because of the
3 pressure of the overlying water.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 4 
  More heat is necessary to turn the water to steam at the
4 bottom of the tube than at the top.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 5 
  Water vapor at the top of the tube (at the surface of the
  geyser pool) can be raised above its boiling point soley
  by the application of more heat after the water has
5 been made to boil.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 6 
  If salt were added to the water the boiling point of
6 the water would be lowered.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 7 
  The geyser erupts because the overflow of water releases
  pressure throughout the whole tube, lowering the boiling
  point at all levels sufficiently to allow the water to turn
7 to steam.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 8 
  Air pressure on a fine day is usually higher than on a
  stormy day. Thus the geyser will erupt more often during
9 stormy weather.

 2Glass is a solid material of great hardness and amazing stability
 2that is made by fusing a batch of dry, powdered, or granular
 2inorganic chemical compounds. Usually, 60% or more of sand with
 2various percentages of two or more oxides of Na, Ca, K, Pb, Mg, and
 2Al is heated in a refractory container, until a bubbling syrup
 2is formed at a blinding white heat by the mutual solution of the
 2metal oxides. Heating is continued at a lower temperature until
 2the bubbles disappear and the syrup becomes homogeneous. Then,
 2if the formula is a good one, if the melting or fusing has been
 2correct, and if the cooling is done properly, the syrup will
 2stiffen continuously from its liquid or molten state at about
 22700 degrees F. to a hard, rigid solid at room temperature without
 2any crystallization taking place.
 2Soda-lime glasses are used for 90 per cent of all glassware. Their
 2raw materials are the least expensive and they are among the
 2easiest to melt and shape.
 2Lead oxide is a good fluxing agent and in percentages of 20 and 40
 2it can replace most or all of the lime and some of the soda or
 2alkali content. This gives glasses greater sparkle and makes
 2them easier to cut and engrave. They are used to make fine
 2tableware and art-glass. About 1758, John Colland realized that the
 2higher index of refraction of a lead glass, that accounts for its
 2higher sparkle and luster, makes possible compound lenses that
  are achromatic.
 2Fused quartz or fused silica glass (99.8% silica) can be made by
 2fusing a batch consisting solely of quartz crystals or of sand
 2(impure crystals of quartz). in this type, unfortunately, the
 2fusing or melting temperature is as high (about 3150 degrees F.)
 2as that of the crystalline raw materials. This requires special
 2melting methods and the molten glass is so viscous that it is
 2difficult to make it homogeneous and free of bubbles.
 2Borosilicate glasses are a type in which the melting point of
 2the silica is lowered by the addition of boric oxide, b2o3, and in
  smaller amount alumina, Al O , with only the smallest possible
 4                          2 3
 2amount of alkali. It is intrinsically superior to corrosion and to
 2breakage from heat shock, but is more difficult to manufacture and
 2work. Borosilicates have ample margin of heat shock resistance,
 2some of which can be sacrificed in making articles that are
 2thicker walled and thus mechanically stronger.
 296% Silica glasses were developed by corning in 1939. first, the
 2article is formed from a conventional borosilicate glass. Then a
 2heat treatment causes the glass to separate into two
 2intermingled glassy phases. One phase contains nearly all of the
 2alkalies and can be leached out by hot acids to leave a sponge-like
 2glass containing 96% silica and 3% B O . The leached glass is so
 3                                    2 3
 2refractory that subsequent heating can close the pores completely
 2without any change of the shape of the article even though there is
 2a linear shrinkage of about 14%.  These glasses can be used at a red
 2heat and plunged into ice water repeatedly without cracking.

  Glass is a chemical compound because, at a blinding white heat, any
  two substances react to form a compound.
  At ordinary temperature, glass could be called a solid-liquid
1 because its molecules are scattered about as in liquids.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 2 
2 In the manufacture of glass, the batch is heated to 2700 degrees F.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 3 
  Lead glass lenses are used in optical instruments because
3 of their high sparkle.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 4 
  Borosilicate glasses are used for most heat-resistant glass ware
  (such as pyrex ovenware) because they are the only heat-resistant
  glasses that can be produced by conventional mass production
9 into two intermingled glassy phases by heat treatment.

0 muriatic acid.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 1 
  Of the following methods, Lavoisier would best support his
  contention that the acidity of muriatic acid is due to the
  presence of oxygen by
    A. showing that oxygenated muriatic acid is stronger than
          muriatic acid itself
    B. showing that all other oxygen-containing substances are
          acidic
    C. showing that other substances are capable of uniting with a
          sufficient amount of oxygen to form acids
    D. preparing muriatic acid by combining a non-acidic or weakly-
          acidic substance with oxygen
1   E. isolating oxygen as a decomposition product of muriatic acid
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 2 
  The subsequent discovery that muriatic acid contains no oxygen
    A. invalidates the criteria by which Lavoisier identified acids
    B. excludes muriatic acid from the class of acids
    C. necessitates postulating another element as the cause of
          acidity
    D. makes this one exception necessary to the theory that oxygen
          is the cause of acidity
    E. invalidates the oxygen theory of acidity but retains the
2         criteria by which acids are recognized
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 3 
  Lavoisier states, we cannot have the slightest doubt that it
  (muriatic acid), like all other acids is composed by the union of
  oxygen with an acidifiable base.  This statement may be best
  characterized as
    A. a tentative hypothesis designed to guide further investigation
    B. a redefinition of the term "acid" in terms of observables
    C. a conclusion arising from similarity of properties of muriatic
          acid and oxygen-containing acids
    D. an inference from experimental data on muriatic acid
    E. a necessary consequence of the theory that all substances
3         containing a maximum amount of oxygen are acids
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 4 
  In view of the subsequent finding that muriatic acid contains no
  oxygen, which of the following comments is best justified?
    A. Lavoisier erred in basing conclusions on qualitative rather
          than quantitative data.
    B. Lavoisier violated his own precepts by making hypotheses.
    C. Lavoisier's error demonstrates the need of an atomic theory
          as a guiding principle.
    D. To the extent that a scientist may feel it unnecessary to
          prove all highly probably conclusions, Lavoisier was
          justified.
    E. Lavoisier's entire scheme of classification is invalid, since
9         it contains a false assumption.

      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 4 
  In terms of Lavoisier's criteria for adequate chemical evidence,
  proof that ordinary air is composed of the two parts, "mephitis"
  and "highly" respirable air, requires that Lavoisier
    A. use no more than the results of the experiments mentioned
          in the previous questions
    B. prove that "mephitis" and "highly" respirable air cannot
          themselves be separated into any more substances
    C. show that no substance other than air is composed of
        "mephitis" and "highly" respirable air.
    D. show that "mephitis" and "highly" respirable air can each be
          obtained from other compound substances, although not
          necessarily from the same compound substances
    E. show that when "mephitis" and "highly" respirable air only
          are combined in the proportions in which they were obtained

 2Davy found that the combining volumes of oxygen with 100 volumes of
0 nitrogen are 49.5, 108.9 and 204.7.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 1 
  From these results Gay-Lussac concluded that the volume ratios
  are 2:1, 1:1, and 1:2.  What justification did Gay-Lussac have for
  such a conclusion?
    A. The measured values are closer to these simple ratios than to
          any others.
    B. Combination in definite proportions had already been
          established; simple volume ratios are, therefore, to be
          expected.
    C. The other gas reactions studied showed similar clusterings
          of data around simple ratios.
    D. Although subsequent measurements justified the conclusion,
          these data do not justify it.

  Rayleigh found that the density of nitrogen isolated from air is
  about 0.47% greater than that of nitrogen prepared by chemical
  means. May this difference be regarded as significant?
    A. Only if two kinds of nitrogen gas are assumed to exist
    B. Only if this difference is much larger than the experimental
          error involved
    C. Only if the experimental error is considered to be zero
    D. Any discrepancy among related data must be regarded as
          significant

      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 3 
  In view of your answers to the preceding two items, what general
  statement may be made as to the criteria for significance of
  deviations in experimental data?
    A. The point at which deviations are great enough to be considered
          significant are arbitrarily decided by each investigator
          concerned.
    B. Deviations of less than 1% may be attributed to experimental
          error but greater deviations are real.
    C. Deviations may be considered significant only if they
          reappear in a great many similar measurements.
    D. The only criterion is whether or not the best theory
          available can account for such deviations.
    E. The significance of deviations is determined by the precision
9         of measurement.

  account for the fact that a wax candle burns only for a short time
  in a closed jar, but can be burned again if the jar is opened?
    A. The amount of Phlogiston in the wax is limited.
    B. The atmosphere can become saturated with Phlogiston.
    C. Part of the Phlogiston is in stable combination with the wax.
    D. Phlogiston is repelled by the atmosphere under certain

  Which of the following observations is most difficult to explain
  on the basis of the statements given above about the Phlogiston
  theory?
    A. Air in which mercury is heated decreases in volume.
    B. Combustion of some substances results in an increase in
          weight; combustion of others, in a decrease.
    C. Air in which mercury is heated is rendered unfit for breathing.
    D. Air in which the red calx of mercury is strongly heated
          supports combustion more vigorously than does ordinary
          air.
    E. If a candle is burned in a closed vessel, the total weight
9         of the contents does not change.

  On mixing the mephitic air with vital air in the proportion
  of 73 to 27, Lavoisier obtained a gas precisely similar to
  atmospheric air in all its properties, how can this result, taken
  by itself, be reconciled with the Phlogiston theory?
    A. By postulating an excess of Phlogiston in mephitic air and a
          deficiency in vital air.
    B. By identifying vital air as Phlogiston and mephitic air as
          dephlogisticated air.
    C. By postulating that mephitic air is pure Phlogiston.
    D. No reconciliation is necessary since the rival theories
          agree on the interpretation of this result.
    E. No reconciliation is possible; this result is incompatible
9         with the Phlogiston theory.

  According to the Phlogiston theory, when wood burns its ashes
  weigh less than the original wood, and the decrease in weight may
  be reasonably interpreted as the weight of the Phlogiston which
  has escaped. When a metal is heated, however, the resulting
  powder weighs more than the original metal. In terms of the
  Phlogiston theory, this would seem to indicate that
    A. Phlogiston could also have a negative weight, so that its
          escape would therefore make a substance heavier
    B. Burning is a different chemical process than that which
          is involved in the heating of a metal until it changes
          into a powder
    C. While burning liberates Phlogiston, heating a metal attracts
          Phlogiston
    D. In burning a substance some of the Phlogiston which is
          present is consumed as the product of combustion, while in
          heating a metal Phlogiston combines with the metal to
          form scale

  When a large jar is placed over a lighted candle, the candle
  burns for a few minutes and then goes out. On the basis of the
  Phlogiston theory, this would suggest that
    A. all the Phlogiston in the air was consumed by the burning
          candle
    B. the air in the jar became saturated with Phlogiston
    C. the air in the jar becaue too hot to receive Phlogiston
    D. carbon dioxide produced by the burning candle extinguished
          the flame
    E. this is a phenomenon that could not be explained by the
9         Phlogiston theory

 2Read the following selection carefully.
 2The northwestern tip of Quebec just south of Baffin Island, is
 2flat, sodden tundra sprinkled thickly with little lakes.  Most of
 2them are irregularly shaped.  But prospector Fred W. Chubb noticed,
 2while poring over an aerial photograph, that one lake was almost
 2round and surrounded by a wall of rock.  This week Dr. V. B. Meen,
 2field geologist Ontario Department of Mines, returned from a quick
 2air visit to the lake and reported that it was almost certainly a
 2meteorite crater (there was no lava or other sign of volcanic
 2activity), and the biggest yet discovered.  The lake in the crater
 2is two and one-half miles across compared with Arizona's famed
 2meteorite crater, which is four-fifths of a mile across.  Its
 2level is about 90 feet above that of other small lakes in the
 2vicinity, and around it is a ring of shattered granite that rises
 2550 feet above the tundra.  The rim is lowest on the north-west
 2side, which suggests that the meteorite came from that direction
  and hit the ground obliquely.
 2Dr. Meen found no meteoric iron, only a reddish rock that might
 2prove to be the peculiar stony material of which some meteorites
 2are made.  But there was plenty of other evidence that some enormous
 2body had buried itself in the earth  shattered blocks of stone from
 2football to freight-car size, and concentric circles in the granite
 2around the crater, like ripples stirred up by a pebble dropped
 2into still water.  Dr. Meen estimated that the meteorite must have
 2fallen at least 3,000 years ago, since there are no Indian or
 2Eskimo legends about it.  He named it Chubb crater after the
 2sharp-eyed prospector, and promised that a full-dress expedition
 2would report on it within a year.  Time, August 14, 1950. by

  The face of the moon shows many craters similar to the Chubb and
  Arizona craters, most of which are larger than either of these.
  If these craters on the moon were formed by meteorites, why are
  there fewer of them on the earth?
    A. The moon has no atmosphere, and therefore there is no erosion
          working on the moon to destroy the craters.
    B. More meteorites strike the moon than the earth because the
          moon is located out in space where the meteorites can
          reach it more easily.
    C. The moon is smaller than the earth and therefore the moon is
          more susceptible to being buffeted by meteorites.
    D. The natural laws that operate on the earth do not operate
          on the moon.
    E. The moon is older than the earth, and therefore has had more

 2The following exercise follows the general pattern of scientific
 2thinking. A scientist on observation of a given phenomenon
 2formulates an hypothesis or several hypotheses, which are
 2tentative explanations of the phenomenon. He then thinks about the
 2hypothesis or hypotheses in terms of his data. Finally, he derives
 2from his data and his thinking about the hypothesis or hypotheses
 2a general conclusion, which is his best answer to the problem
 2presented by the phenomenon. Be sure to read the directions
 2carefully and to follow them explicitly. Base your judgments
 2wholly on the information given in the selection. You may refer
 2back to the selection as often as you wish.
 2As the words imply, a continuous spectrum is a spectrum in which
 2there is a continuous band of colors from one end to the other.
 2This necessarily means that the light source is emitting all
 2frequencies of light between the spectral limits. A bright-line
 2spectrum is a spectrum in which there are one or more vertical lines
 2of light in certain specific positions. This means that the light
 2source is emitting light waves of certain specific frequencies.
 2In the isolated atom the electrons have certain definite and
 2characteristic motions, which are related to the emission or
 2absorption of light waves of certain specific frequencies. Hence,
 2when atoms are sufficiently far apart, as in a rarefied gas, and
 2are heated to incandescence, the light waves emitted from them
 2produce the bright-line spectrum characteristic of the elements
 2of the luminous source. However, when the natural motions of
 2electrons of each atom are altered by force due to the presence
 2of nearby atoms, as in the case of a condensed gas, liquid, or
 2solid, the light waves emitted, instead of being of certain
 2specific frequencies, are of numerous different frequencies.
 2Therefore, incandescent solids, liquids, and dense gases produce
  continuous spectra. Rarefied gases produce bright-line spectra.
 2As previously stated, because of the forces exerted upon them by
 2their neighbors, atoms of solids and liquids have their emitting
 2frequency ranges greatly widened. For the same reason their
 2absorbing frequency ranges are likewise widened. On the other
 2hand, since the atoms of vapors and gases at ordinary or low
 2pressures are comparatively free to emit waves of their own
 2natural frequencies, they can absorb waves of those particular
 2frequencies. Consequently, the absorption spectrum of a vapor is
 2a spectrum in which there are dark lines corresponding to the
 2bright lines in the bright-line spectrum that the vapor would
  yield if it were incandescent.
 2The spectrum obtained from the glowing carbon of a carbon arc is
 2continuous and has no vertical lines. When sodium metal is heated
 2in a metal spoon held over the flame of a bunsen burner placed
 2below the arc, sodium vapor is produced, which surrounds and to
 2some extent obscures the arc. A dark line then appears in the
 2spectrum of the arc. If the burner and spoon are removed and a tiny
 2piece of sodium is inserted between the terminals of the arc, a
 2bright yellow line instantly appears in the exact position
 2previously occupied by the dark line.
 2When light from the sun is observed by means of a spectroscope, the
 2continuous spectrum contains a number of vertical lines, which
 2appear dark by contrast with the rest of the spectrum.

 2The following passage concerns the caloric theory
 2of heat. The items concern an evaluation of the theory.
 2Read the passage carefully before answering.
 2The caloric theory of heat was the most widely accepted theory
 2of heat in the early 19th century. It was recognized by a large
 2majority of the leading men of science, many of whom contributed
 2greatly to the advance of science in their time. It stated
 2      A. heat was a fluid, caloric, which was made up of
 2         particles or corpuscles.
 2      B. the corpuscles were able to push their way between
 2         the particles (molecules) of matter.
 2      C. the corpuscles were mutually repellent (much as
 2         the electrons of negative electricty).
 2      D. all matter attracted the corpuscles but some matter
 2         more strongly than other matter.
 2      E. the fluid was indestructible and could not be created.

 2The following questions refer to Figure 5. In the Linde
 2process for making liquid air, the gas, thoroughly
 2freed from water vapor, is first compressed to a high pressure
 5                   2
  (some 2000 lbs./in. ) by a pump (p in Figure 5).  It is then
 2cooled in an ice-water bath w. The cool air then passes
 2into an expansion chamber e, being driven through the inner of
 2two tubes and escapes at the bottom through a small adjustable
 2hole h.  It is drawn back through the outer tube by the suction
 2side of the double-acting pump. The expansion cools the air.
 2Thus the incoming stream of air is cooled by the outgoing one,
 2and this cooling process is progressive, so that, if heat is
 2prevented from getting into the expansion chamber from outside,
 2the expanding air eventually cools itself to a temperature
 2below its boiling point, when drops of liquid form by condensation
 2and fall into the vacuum vessel at the bottom, where it is kept
 2until needed. Using this information, answer the
0 following questions.

  According to Rutherford, "atoms of matter are not solid spheres,
  but empty structures consisting of extremely minute particles
  separated by relatively great distances." however, from cloud
  chamber observations, it was noted that fast-moving alpha particles
  passing through a gas may be slowed down and even stopped without
  ever hitting one of these minute particles in the center of the
  atoms of the gas! this can be explained by assuming that
    A. Rutherford was not exactly correct, and that there is really a
          thin sort of matter within the atom as well as the
          minute particles
    B. the alpha particles passing through the gas lost their
          initial kinetic energy, and therefore their slowing down
          was not due to any action of the gas
    C. while the atoms of the gas may consist of empty structures
          containing only minute particles separated by relatively
          great distances, nevertheless there is probably a tenuous
          membrane stretched between the outer surfaces of the atoms
          which acts to slow down and stop the alpha particles
    D. the alpha particles contain great quantities of static
          electricity charge which react with the minute particles
          within the atoms of the gas to slow down and stop these
          particles
    E. powerful electric fields exist within the atoms of the gas
          itself, and that it is these fields which may slow down
9         or stop the particles

  According to Rutherford's calculations, the deflection d of an
  alpha particle of mass m, initial speed v, and charge  2e moving
  initially so as to pass at a distance of p an atomic nucleus of
  charge  ne, is given by the equation

          the target area presented by the region capable of
          producing such a deflection.

  A physicist, using the accumulated data concerning the nature of
  the atomic nucleus, constructed a model of the nucleus of a certain
  atom. In doing this, he used the physical laws known to describe the
  behavior of large-scale phenomena. He discovered, however, that the
  theoretical behavior of his model did not agree with the actual
  behavior of the atomic nucleus. After checking carefully his
  original data, checking carefully his mathematics, and trying models
  of the nuclei of the atoms of several different elements, the
  results still did not agree. If all of the statements in the above

  It was realized during the nineteenth century that the
  characteristic physical and chemical properties of the metallic
  elements can be explained as due to a tendency of their atoms to
  become positively charged. This tendency is accounted for in
  Bohr's theory of the atom as a direct result of metallic atoms
  having
    A. few electrons
    B. many electrons
    C. relatively low ionization energy in their most stable states
    D. electrons in the outermost electron shell
9   E. quantum numbers greater than those of non-metallic atoms

  The principal reason for the existence of the problem attacked by
  Bohr was that
    A. while radiation is emitted by atoms in a discrete fashion as
          far as frequency is concerned (line spectra), the emission
          nevertheless appears to be continuous in time.
    B. the observed scattering of alpha particles, according to
          Rutherford, is compatible only with a nuclear model of the
          atom.
    C. radiation phenomena indicate that, since atoms emit light, they
          must lose energy, and thus cannot exist in "stationary"
          states of constant energy; on the other hand, stationary
          states are required to account for the stability of the
          atom.
    D. the Rutherford atom could not be stable if its electrons were
          at rest, nor, according to Maxwell's electrodynamics, if
          they were in motion; on the otherhand, the Planck-Einstein
          theory of radiation involved concepts different from and
          contradictory to those of Maxwell's theory.
    E. the fact that elements have characteristic spectra, exhibited
          by them both in the uncombined state and in compounds,
          indicates that these spectra are due to processes within
9         individual atoms.

 2The first set of relationships established by Bohr in his
 2discussion of systems consisting of a single electron revolving
 2about a nucleus is given by the formulae
  
 5      1/2      3/2                   1/2
  w = (2   ) x (u   )/(p  x e  x e  x m   )/u
 4                      1    1    2
  
 2            2 x r =(e  x e )/u
 4                     1    2
  
 2where w is the orbital frequency of an electron of charge e  and

 4                                           2
  and ionization energy u.
  The importance of these relationships in Bohr's theory lies in the
  fact that
    A. they give the radius of the orbit and the frequency of
          revolution as functions of the charge of the electron.
    B. they give the radius of the orbit and the frequency of
          revolution as functions of the charge of the nucleus.
    C. they give the radius of the orbit and the frequency of
          revolution as functions of the ionization energy.
    D. they express Bohr's hypothesis concerning the necessary and
          sufficient conditions for the existence of stationary
          states.
9   E. they determine the size of the atom.

      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 1 
  In Rutherford's calculations, he assumes that the atom with which
  an alpha particle interacts is at rest during the interaction.
  The mass of a gold atom is approximately 50 times the mass of an
 5                                                            9
  alpha particle. If a single alpha particle, moving at 2 x 10
  cm./sec., meets a gold atom and is deflected through 180 degrees,
  emerging at the same speed with which it entered, and if the total
  momentum of the particle and the atom is the same before and after
  the encounter, the atom must have acquired a speed of
    A. zero
 5           -2
    B. 2 x 10   cm./sec.
    C. 1 cm./sec.
 5           7
    D. 8 x 10  cm./sec.
 5           8
1   E. 5 x 10  cm./sec.
      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 2 
  In the light of the considerations given in the preceding item,
  which of the following remarks is justified concerning the status
  of Rutherford's assumption that the atoms are stationary?
    A. In the experiments cited by Rutherford, the speeds of the alpha
 5                                            9
          particles were only 1.7 and 1.8 x 10  cm./sec., so that the
          result of the calculation in the preceding item is not
          directly relevant.
    B. Rutherford is entitled to assume that the forces between the
          atoms, which give the metal its solidity, prevent any one
          atom from acquiring a high speed; the momentum imparted by
          the encounter is therefore not carried by a single atom,
          but shared among many.
    C. The considerations given in the preceding item bear out
          Rutherford's assumption that the velocity imparted to the
          atom is either zero or insignificant.
    D. The considerations given in the preceding item are not easily
          reconciled with Rutherford's assumption; hence, since that
          assumption is required to derive his results (which accord
          with experiment), some modification of classical mechanics--
          possibly giving up the law of the conservation of momentum--
          is indicated.
    E. Rutherford's assumption is not affected by the considerations
          given, since that assumption has the status of a working
          hypothesis which is justified as long as it leads to results
9         borne out by experiment.

          electron in the atom are in fact stable (classical physics
          not withstanding)?

  It is sometimes alleged that the occurrence of discrete bright-line
  spectra provides clear evidence that atoms have discrete energy
  levels. The existence of such line spectra was known, however, for
  the better part of a century before discrete energy levels were
  postulated for the atom. This situation is explained by the
  circumstance that
    A. it was not known that there is a connection between radiation
          and energy
    B. it was not clear that the bright-line spectra are produced
          by processes occuring within atoms
    C. the conclusion does not follow unless it is assumed that atoms
          are divisible, and composed of electrified particles
    D. only Bohr's theory of atomic constitution made clear the role
          of discrete energy levels
    E. only on the basis of Planck's theory of radiation could a
          connection be expected between frequencies of radiation
9         and energy states of atoms emitting the radiation

      MACRO SUB-ITEM # 1 
  The general proposition set forth as a new discovery
  by Kirchhoff and Bunsen, in their report of their investigation
  of spectra, is that
    A. certain substances placed in a flame, or otherwise
          made to emit light, give a spectrum containing
          bright lines
    B. the capacity of a substance to absorb light of a
          given frequency is inversely proportional to its
          capacity to emit such light
    C. the capacity of a substance to absorb light of a
          given frequency is directly proportional to its
          capacity to emit such light
    D. the bright lines occuring in the spectra of certain
          metals are within wide limits determined by the
          metal, independently of chemical combination and
          of the process producing the luminosity
    E. no two substances can emit light of the same frequency;
          thus a study of the light emitted permits an
1         identification of the source

  theoretical difficulty in the way of attempting to
  characterize the behavior of light in terms of Newtonian
  "rays"?
    A. Separation of the components of composite light
          by a prism, which would force one to assert that
          there are at a given point in a beam of light an
          infinite number of rays
    B. The spreading out of a beam of light in passing
          through a small hole, which destroys the possibility
          of subdividing such a beam indefinitely into ever-narrower
          parts
    C. The speed at which light travels, which is so enormously
          great as to be an insuperable obstacle to any
          attempt to separate a "chunk" of light disconnected
          from its source
    D. The fact that the light always travels with the same
          speed in a vacuum, which means that no physical
          agency can alter the speed of a ray unless it passes
          into a refracting medium

 2For the following items, the notation used is as follows  M(A/Z),
 2where M is the symbol for the element or particle, A is the atomic
 2mass and Z is the atomic number or charge. Thus uranium 238 becomes
 2U(238/92). Now, consider the following nuclear reactions
 2              U(238/92) + n(1/0) ---> U(239/92)
 2              U(239/92) ---> Np(239/93) + energy + e(0/-1)

 2If the neutron concentration becomes too high as shown by neutron
 2counters placed within the pile the condition is corrected by
 2insertion of Cd bars. An outside continuous source of neutrons
 2is not required because neutrons are supplied by fission of
 2some of the U-235 atoms and by fission of some of the newly formed
 2Pu-239 (the product of the pile). Using this information, answer
0 the following questions.

  The sun radiates a large amount of energy as a result of the union
  of four hydrogen atoms to form the helium atom. The reason for this
  release of energy is that
    A. the hydrogen atoms are in a high state of thermal excitation

  Molecules of a dye can move at the rate of 200 miles per
  hour but they may actually require weeks to diffuse an
  inch up a tube of water. This phenomenon can be
  accounted for
    A. because the dye molecules move upward slowly due
          to the pull of gravity
    B. because other molecules impede upward movement
          of the dye molecules by constantly changing the
          direction of their movements

  Molecular motions are maintained by no outside force,
  yet continue indefinitely with no sign of diminishing
  speed. The reason that friction does not bring these
  tiny particles to rest, as it does other moving particles,
  is that
    A. the molecules are too far apart for friction to have
          any effect
    B. the molecular speed and momentum are too great for
          the force of friction to have any effect
    C. friction between molecules would merely mean a
          transformation of one form of molecular energy into
          another form of molecular energy
    D. molecular motion is the result of more than one
          factor--several of which are not affected by friction

  Which of the following is NOT a true statement?
    A. In the collision theory the assumption is made that the
          reaction proceeds through collisions of molecules.
    B. All collisions between molecules are effective.
    C. In order for collisions to be effective,the reactant
          molecules must be properly oriented with respect to each
          other.
    D. The reactant molecules must have sufficient energy to
          produce an effective collision.
    E. The maximum amount of energy required in order for a
          reaction to occur is called the activation energy for
9         that reaction.

  A student made a barometer by filling a long glass tube
  (closed at one end) with mercury, holding his finger
  over the open end and inverting the tube, then placing
  the open end in a dish of mercury and finally removing
  his finger. As a result, some of the mercury ran out of
  the tube but eventually the height of the mercury
  column was 75 cm. of mercury which checked rather
  closely with the laboratory barometer. Experimenting
  further he introduced a drop of water into the lower
  end of the tube and noted that the drop worked its way
  upward and after reaching the top, the barometer read
  73 cm. of mercury. This relatively large decrease in the
  reading is explained as follows
    A. The weight of the water drop on top of the mercury
          caused the decrease.
    B. The drop contained a lot of dissolved air which
          destroyed the vacuum.
    C. The drop vaporized and exerted a vapor pressure.
    D. Moisture in the air always increases a barometer reading.
    E. The water formed a film on top of the mercury and
9         prevented contact with the vacuum space.

  Arrhenius refers to "objections" to his theory "which may
  probably be urged from the chemical side." Which of the following
  could be an objection of this sort?
    A. There is no reason to believe that the osmotic pressures of
          solutions at the same temperature and with the same number
          of particles are necessarily equal.
    B. Arrhenius' theory carries the implication that an electric
          current can cause chemical changes.
    C. Solutions of electrolytes do not possess an electric charge.
    D. The chemical properties of a solution of an electrolyte are
          not the properties of its constituents; e.g., a solution of
          sodium chloride does not have the properties of sodium or
          of chlorine.
    E. When substances dissociate or decompose chemically (as in the
          reaction  NH Cl---> NH  + HCl) the result is an increase

  If two identical vacuum bottles, one filled with coffee at
  0 degrees C. and the other with coffee at 100 degrees C.,
  are placed in a room at normal temperature (about 22 degrees C.),

  When a hot iron touches a block of ice, the iron cools but the
  ice does not warm; some ice melts. The final temperature of the
  system (iron, ice, and water) is the same as the initial
  temperature of the ice. From this experiment, one might conclude
  that
    A. since ice has a higher specific heat than iron it will melt
          with greater speed.
    B. the data are false because hot iron and ice cannot be brought
          into intimate contact without raising the temperature of the
          ice.
    C. heat is a fluid and flows into the ice, thus substantiating
          the caloric theory.

 2The following questions refer to the electromotive series. In
 2the series, hydrogen is listed at zero potential. Above hydrogen
 2the potentials increase positively and below it the potentials
 2increase in the negative sense, e.g., Al has a potential of +1.67
 2while gold has a potential of -1.68. Zn will displace H from
 2dilute acids and Zn will displace Ag from salts of Ag. The tendency
 2to go to the reduced state increases as one proceeds from top to
 2bottom in the series, while the tendency to go to the oxidized
 2state increases from gold to sodium.

      MACROITEM STEM
  The facts below relate to the following six items.
    i. Alkanes can be halogenated by free radical reaction.
  
 5                  heat           .
           X  --------------->  2 X
 4          2  or UV light
  
 5          .                                 .

 5          .                                 .
           R   +  X   ------------->  RX  +  X

 5  .                                         .    .   .     .
  "X " represents a Halide radical, such as Cl , Br , I  or F
  and the dot signifies an unpaired electron.  R is an alkyl group.
   ii. An asymmetric Carbon atom is a Carbon atom which is
  surrounded by four different groups.  For example, in the
  compound     Cl
               |
 4              *
 4         H C-C-CH -CH  , the halogenated carbon (*) is an
 4          3      2   3
 4             |           asymmetric Carbon atom.  A compound
               Br          that contains an asymmetric Carbon
                           atom is considered to be optically active.
  iii. Free rotation about a double bond does not occur.  The
  absence of free rotation produces cis- and trans-
  isomers:
               R     R'       R     H
                \   /          \   /
                 C=C            C=C
                /   \          /   \
               H     H        H     R'
                cis            trans
   iv. Carbon atoms can be classified generally by the number of
  additional carbons attached to them.
 5                      o
     A primary carbon (1 ) is attached to one other carbon atom.
 5                        o
     A secondary carbon (2 ) is attached to two other carbon atoms.
 5                       o
     A tertiary carbon (3 ) is attached to three other carbon atoms.
    v. An alkene can be synthesized from an alkyl halide by the
  dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides.  The reaction proceeds
 5    o  o  o
  by 3 >2 >1  in ease of dehydrohalogenation of alkyl halides.

  The two explanations for the fluctuation in the mean global
  temperature are as follows:
  (A)  loss of heat into space decreases because of the buildup of
  CO , so the earth heats up (carbon dioxide reradiates the heat
 4  2
  back to earth).
  (B)  the buildup of particles in the air (turbidity) allows the
  sun's rays to penetrate more easily, allowing the earth to heat
  up.
  (C)  the buildup of particles in the air (turbidity) causes the
  incoming light to be reflected or scattered, thereby decreasing
  the amount of heat that reaches the earth.
  (D)  the earth cools off because the CO  content in the air is
 4                                       2
  building up so that CO  absorbs more of the sun's rays.

  The instructor demonstrates some properties of five elements:
  sodium, oxygen, aluminum, nitrogen and magnesium.  He removes the
  sodium from a bath of kerosene and uses a knife to cut off several
  small chunks.  One of the chunks is dropped into water and it is
  observed to scoot around on the surface, reacting vigorously.
  A second chunk is placed on an asbestos pad and a bunsen burner
  flame is aimed at the chunk.  After some delay, the chunk begins
  to burn with increasing vigor until it is completely consumed.
  A piece of Mg ribbon is placed in water.  No visible reaction is
  observed.  A beaker covered with a watch glass is filled with N
 4                                                               2
  gas.  A match is lighted and the watch glass is removed.  The match
  is lowered into the beaker where it is extinguished.  A piece of
  Mg ribbon is placed in a bunsen burner flame, where it begins to
  react.  It is then lowered into the beaker and it continues to
  react.  A piece of Al foil is placed in a bunsen burner flame
  where it shrivels and sags but does not otherwise react visibly.
  Some Al powder is mixed with sodium peroxide and the mixture is
  poured into a pile on the asbestos pad.  A short piece of Mg
  ribbon is inserted in the mixture and ignited.  The flame travels
  down the ribbon until it reaches the mixture, which then begins
  to react vigorously.

  A commercial analytical laboratory received a colorless liquid
  sample with a distinctive odor.  An instrumental analysis was
  immediately undertaken.  Gas chromatographic data showed only
  one peak very close to the injection mark.  This meant the
  sample contained only one relatively low boiling component.
  From the mass spectrometer connected to the gas chromatograph,
  the following data were obtained:
                                      P   =  58
                                      P+1 =   2.27
                                      P+2 =   0.42
  The P or Parent Peak gives the molecular weight of the substance
  to the nearest whole number.  The P+1 peak is the relative
  % abundance of isotopes of
